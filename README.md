# Network Traffic Analysis Using Wireshark

This repository contains my internship project on **Network Traffic Analysis using Wireshark**, completed as part of the **Ethical Hacking internship** at **Inlighnx Global Pvt Ltd (Inlighnx Tech)**.

## 📌 Project Overview
The objective of this project is to capture and analyze live network traffic to understand client–server communication and the behavior of different network protocols. Wireshark was used to monitor real-time packets generated while accessing websites and performing network diagnostic activities.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Capture live network packets using Wireshark  
- Analyze TCP three-way handshake  
- Filter and study TCP, UDP, HTTP, DNS, and ICMP packets  
- Understand packet-level communication and security risks  

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- Wireshark  
- Windows / Linux Operating System  
- Web Browser  
- Command Prompt / Terminal  

## 🔍 Methodology
- Selected the active network interface (Wi-Fi/Ethernet) in Wireshark  
- Captured live traffic while accessing websites  
- Applied display filters for specific protocols  
- Analyzed packet headers, payloads, and protocol behavior  
- Observed encrypted (TLS 1.3) and unencrypted (HTTP) traffic  

## 📡 Protocols Analyzed
- **TCP** – Connection-oriented communication and three-way handshake  
- **UDP** – Connectionless data transfer  
- **HTTP** – Plain-text web communication  
- **DNS** – Domain name resolution  
- **ICMP** – Network diagnostics using ping  

## 🔐 Key Observations
- TCP ensures reliable communication using SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK packets  
- HTTP traffic is visible in plain text, posing security risks  
- TLS 1.3 provides secure, encrypted communication  
- DNS and ICMP support connectivity and diagnostics  

## 📈 Learning Outcomes
- Hands-on experience with packet capture and filtering  
- Improved understanding of network protocols  
- Awareness of cybersecurity threats and secure communication  
- Practical exposure to traffic analysis techniques  

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Malware traffic analysis  
- IDS/IPS integration  
- Advanced network forensics  
- SIEM-based traffic monitoring
